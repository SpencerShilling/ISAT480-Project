<h3>Capstone Project: Dark Ships</h3>
<p>November 2021-Present<p>
<p>
As part of my degree in Integrated Science and Technology, several peers and I are working within a group to create a system capable of tracking ships in the ocean that have turned off their AIS tracking systems. We achieved this by utilizing the Yolov7 machine learning model on SARS satellite images to create an algorithm that can detect whether or not an image contains a ship.

<h3>Flask Database</h3>
<p>Used flask as an intermediary between an html webpage hosted on an Amazon server and an SQL database allowing one to read and write to the database from the webpage. Done as a class project</p>
